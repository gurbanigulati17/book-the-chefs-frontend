THESE TERMS AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THEN YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE OUR SERVICE. 

                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time without incurring any liability or obligation.  See below under the heading “Modification of The Service and Terms” for more information. 

                The personal information you provide through the Service shall be collected, used, managed and disclosed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <h2>BooktheChefs</h2>
                <p>These Terms are between you and BooktheChefs (“BooktheChefs”) .When used in these Terms, the terms “us”, “we” and “our” refer to BooktheChefs.</p>
                <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
                <p>We provide a way for you to order (“Order”) products or services (“Products”) from third party restaurants (“Restaurants”). BooktheChefs is a limited agent for its Restaurant partners with the authority to offer a Restaurant’s Products for sale at the price shown through the Service. BooktheChefs has the authority to accept or decline your Order on behalf of the Restaurant and collect payment for your Order on behalf of the Restaurant.  BooktheChefs also has the authority to provide certain discounts and promotional offers in connection with Products offered through the Service. BooktheChefs does not provide the Products itself or operate any of the Restaurants, and is not itself a restaurant. BooktheChefs is not responsible for the quality, character or safety of any Products available through the Service, that is the sole responsibility of the Restaurant. The provision of the Product and fulfilment of any Orders by the Restaurant to you constitutes an agreement entered into between you and the Restaurant. BooktheChefs shall never be a party to such agreement.</p>
                <h2>SIGNING UP</h2>
                <p>You have to be at least the age of majority or older in your jurisdiction of residence in order to use the Service. If you reside in a jurisdiction that restricts the use of the Service because of your age, or restricts the ability to enter into contracts such as this one due to age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not use the Service. 

                By using the Service, you are entering into a contract with BooktheChefs under these Terms. In order to be able to use the Service, you first need to sign-up with BooktheChefs. When signing-up, you are obligated to provide BooktheChefs with certain personal information, including your mobile telephone number and payment card data. Upon successfully signing-up with BooktheChefs, BooktheChefs shall provide you with a personal account, accessible to you with a password of your choice. 

                You warrant that the information you provide to BooktheChefs is accurate and complete and that you shall keep the information you have provided to BooktheChefs current through the Service. BooktheChefs is entitled at all times to verify the information that you have provided and to refuse use of the Service without providing reasons. 

                In connection with your use of the Service, BooktheChefs can send you electronic service messages. These electronic messages can be sent for various reasons, including to provide a receipt for your Order, for security purposes (e.g. verifying that your smartphone is connected to the phone number you entered upon registration) and for issues related to an Order you placed (e.g. if the Restaurant is out of stock of an item you ordered, you can be notified by text message).  For information about promotional and marketing messages, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

Neither BooktheChefs nor the Restaurant guarantee that Orders shall be ready for pick-up within the estimated times.


If you have any issues with your Order (including any issue regarding the accuracy of information provided through the Service), or wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been accepted, you can contact us directly (contact@BooktheChefs.com) and we shall assist you in resolving your issue. We cannot guarantee that we can resolve any complaint or issue you have because resolution is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant once an Order has been accepted. If we are unable to assist you in resolving a complaint, you shall need to address it directly with the Restaurant.  All complaints regarding the quality of any Products should be addressed directly to the Restaurant. BooktheChefs has no obligation to compensate you for any dispute you can have with any Restaurant.
